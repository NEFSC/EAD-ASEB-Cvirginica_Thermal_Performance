## About: 
Use mulitple tissue homogenate assays to define the thermal metabolic profile of the Eastern oyster *Crassostrea virginica*.
Our chosen colorimetric assays employ proteins and metabolites involved in aerobic/anaaerobic metabolism and oxidative stress response.

Assays: 

i. Aerobic metabolism (Krebs/TCA cycle): **Citrate synthase assay**

ii. Metabolites/byproducts of anaerobic transition:  **PEPCK**, **Succiante**

iii. Remediation of free radicals: **Total antioxidant capacity**

iv. Damade caused by overproduction of free radicals: **Lipid peroxidantion MDA assay**
